Lately, I have been thinking about how politics make and remake racial categories, and how these categories then shape politics.\nI earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto,1 where I received the Suzanne and Edwin Goodman Prize as the top graduating student in the political science specialization.\nI grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The photo here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red Deer River, nestled in the badlands."
