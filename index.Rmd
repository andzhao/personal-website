## Hello!

I'm a young researcher currently working at [Pollara Strategic Insights](https://www.pollara.com/). I am interested in political behaviour, particularly how marginalized people participate (or *don't* participate) politically. My senior thesis focused on how immigrants participate and incorporate upon moving to a new country.

Outside of work, I love cooking up some mean Chinese food, playing badminton with my friends, and running [SUNIA](https://www.sunia.ca/), an educational summer camp for high school students. 

I am grateful to live and work in Amiskwaciw√¢skahikan (Edmonton) with my dog, Hector. My pronouns are he/him.
