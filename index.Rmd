## Hello!

I'm a young researcher currently working at [Pollara Strategic Insights](https://www.pollara.com/). I am interested in immigration, race, and political participation. My senior thesis focused on how immigrants integrate politically upon moving to the United States.

Outside of work, I love playing rec ball hockey, preserving my grandpa's Chinese recipes, and running [SUNIA](https://www.sunia.ca/), an educational summer camp for high school students. 

I am grateful to live and work in Amiskwaciw√¢skahikan (Edmonton) with my dog, Hector. My pronouns are he/him.
