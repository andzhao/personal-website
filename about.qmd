I am a PhD student in [The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I am also a [Citrin Fellow](https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/).

I am broadly interested in the interplay between race & ethnicity, immigration, and political participation. Specifically, I am interested in:

- How immigrants' pre-migration experiences shape post-migration participation and integration
- Barriers to Asian political participation in the US and Canada
- Experimental methods[^1]

[^1]: With the usual caveat that most students' interests shift as they progress through their PhD program.

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto,[^2] where I received the Suzanne and Edwin Goodman Prize as the top graduating student in the political science specialization.

[^2]: Yes, "honours" with a U. See ["How to be a Propour Canadian Spellour"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200809210544/http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~sousa/spelling.html), courtesy of my first instructor in philosophy.

I grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The picture here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red River, nestled in the badlands.
