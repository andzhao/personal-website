I am an incoming PhD student in [The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I will also be a [Citrin Fellow](https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/). I earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto.

I am broadly interested in the interplay between race & ethnicity, immigration, and political participation. Specifically, I am interested in understanding barriers to participation and developing interventions to overcome those barriers.[^1]

[^1]: With the usual caveat that most students' interests shift as they progress through their PhD.

I grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The picture here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red River, nestled in the badlands.
