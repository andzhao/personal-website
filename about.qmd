I am a PhD student in [The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I am also a [Citrin Fellow](https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/) at the Jack Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research and a [Hildebrand Fellow](https://canada.berkeley.edu/grants-and-awards/edward-e-hildebrand-graduate-research-fellowship) at the Canadian Studies Program.

I am broadly interested in identity and politics. Lately, I have been thinking about how politics make and remake racial categories, and how these categories then shape politics.

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto,[^1] where I received the Suzanne and Edwin Goodman Prize as the top graduating student in the political science specialization.

I grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The photo here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red Deer River, nestled in the badlands.
