I am a PhD student in [The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I am also a [Citrin Fellow](https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/) at the Jack Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research and a [Hildebrand Fellow](https://canada.berkeley.edu/grants-and-awards/edward-e-hildebrand-graduate-research-fellowship) at the Canadian Studies Program.

I am broadly interested in identity and immigration. Lately, I have been thinking about the social construction of race, its methodological implications, and how political scientists can study racism without reifying race.[^1]

[^1]: With the usual caveat that most students' interests shift as they progress through their PhD program.

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto,[^2] where I received the Suzanne and Edwin Goodman Prize as the top graduating student in the political science specialization.

[^2]: Yes, "honours" with a U! See ["How to be a Propour Canadian Spellour"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200809210544/http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~sousa/spelling.html).

I grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The photo here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red River, nestled in the badlands.
