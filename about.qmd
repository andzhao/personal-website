I am a PhD student in [The Charles and Louise Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I am also a [Citrin Fellow](https://citrincenter.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/) at the Jack Citrin Center for Public Opinion Research and a [Hildebrand Fellow](https://canada.berkeley.edu/grants-and-awards/edward-e-hildebrand-graduate-research-fellowship) at the Canadian Studies Program.

I am broadly interested in identity and politics. Lately, I have been thinking about how categories are made and reshaped by politics. I am also curious about how we conceptualize identity and how our conceptualizations affect our understandings of politics. For example, if we think of identity as performed and constructed, we may want to build models of politics that treat identity as politically endogenous rather than as an unmoved mover.[^1]

[^1]: With the usual caveat that most students' interests shift as they progress through their PhD program.

I earned my Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto,[^2] where I received the Suzanne and Edwin Goodman Prize as the top graduating student in the political science specialization.

[^2]: Yes, "honours" with a U! See ["How to be a Propour Canadian Spellour"](https://web.archive.org/web/20200809210544/http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~sousa/spelling.html).

I grew up on the prairies in Treaty 7 territory. The photo here is of me and my dog Hector after taking a dip in the Red Deer River, nestled in the badlands.
